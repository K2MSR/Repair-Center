Completed as a university assignment 

Tasks:

deals with the vehicles on a one by one basis, in the order specifed in the input file.

Each vehicle is worked on by a randomly chosen mechanic.

The mechanic attempts to diagnose the correct problem, with a percentage chance of doing so determined by the mechanic's quality and the problem determination complexity.

If the mechanic fails to identify the correct problem, the mechanic will guess at the problem, which entails them to choose any of the possible problems.

Once a vehicle is diagnosed, the mechanic applies an associated fix

The chance of the treatmentis determined by the mechanic's quality and the problem complexity. If wrong, the fix has a 25% chance to work

Once given a fix the vehicle leaves, regardless of success.
